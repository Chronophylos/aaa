### Did you find a Bug?
**Fist check if the Bug was not already reported** on
* the [Bug-Reports Repo](https://github.com/OpenAngelArena/Bug-Reports/issues)
* our OAA Developer Discord in `#bug-testing-reports`
* or our OAA Community Discord in `#reports_for_devs

Then check you have usefull infos for us like
* the game version you played on (visible in the top left in-game)
* console output pasted on [Pastebin](pastebin.com) or others
  * you can enable your console with the `-console` startup parameter and a keybind you set in your dota settings
  * or you can use the VConsole which is way more powerful by providing `-vconsole` as startup parameter and pressing `~` or `^` depending on your keyboard
* a video or screenshot uploaded somewhere.
